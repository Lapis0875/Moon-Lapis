<center>"상상을 넘어 현실로"</center>

상상하던것들을 자유롭게 만들어내며 놀던 한 아이는 자라서 프로그램을 만들고 있습니다.

## 이런 것들을 할 수 있어요!
* C, as my first programming language.
* Java, as my second programming lang and first OOP lang.
* Android, as my first mobile app developement and my desktop burner.
* Python, as my third programming lang and my main lang.

## 앞으로 이런 것들을 배우고 싶어요!
* All about Git : I think I need to learn more about this.
* C++, as my main low-level lang
* Unity engine, Unreal engine : I want to develop my own game!
* Rust, because I'm interested in Rust's memory concepts.
* Functional langs - I haven't learned about those.

Developement purpose, lapis0875@kakao.com
