# Minecraft Serium Launcher

Custom minecraft launcher based on pml, python minecraft launch module made by ksi123456ab.

Using PyQT5 to make UI, and pml to construct inner logic.



## Features

1. Launch Minecraft (W.I.P.)

   Basic function of minecraft launcher is "Launching the game". This will be built with pml.

   I hope this launcher can support both vanila and forge minecraft, because I'm a big fan of modded minecraft â™¥

2. Skin Setting (Just thinking)

   Like official Minecraft Launcher 2.0, I want to add skin setting function. This will make players to change their skin easily!

3. Themes

   Various kinds of color palletes, icons, UIs and more! Themes function will make your launcher more fancy



## When I can use this launcher?

I'll develope this as regularly as possible, but as a studen't, I don't have much time to do so.

But, I'll post my works at this blog, so you can see how much this launcher is being developed.
